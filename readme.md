Week 4 day 3 api testing lab

In this lab, I interacted with two APIs: SWAPI and Social Mountain. I used SWAPI to fetch specific data like Darth Vader's height and the population of Alderaan. With Social Mountain API, I learned about creating, updating, and deleting posts. The lab provided valuable experience in working with different API endpoints and handling various types of requests.
